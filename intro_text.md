Major Questions we aimed to answer:
  1.What drives a song's popularity on Spotify?
  2.How do music listening habits vary across different regions and cultures?
  3.What impact do release types (singles vs. albums) have on listener engagement?
  4.Are there observable trends in music energy levels and explicit content across various genres and countries?
  
Our Data:
Our first dataset is focused on comprehensive data sets about top artists obtained from Spotify, which were then sorted and organized by an online Kaggle user. This offers detailed information on songs, artists, and user listening trends. We found this along with our second data set, which revolves around the top songs of 2024 in many different countries. These two datasets gave us information on how artists related to their songs and the countries their songs were popular in. We attemped to analyze the connection between music trends and geographical location to gain an understanding on how music may show culture.

Data and Ethical Considerations:
A few ethical considerations for our data sets might be about user privacy, data anonymization, and consent. However, since the data is aggregated and people are aware that their listening trends are already tracked by Spotify, we believe that this is not too big of a deal.

Limitations:
One limitation for our datasets is that in the second dataset, only certain countries are included. There could be many countries that are not included and this may skew our data. We are limited to just a few countries and cannot expand our analysis past this point.
