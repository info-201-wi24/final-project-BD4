# Introduction
Major Questions we aimed to answer:
  1.What drives a song's popularity on Spotify?
  2.How do music listening habits vary across different regions and cultures?
  3.What impact do release types (singles vs. albums) have on listener engagement?
  4.Are there observable trends in music energy levels and explicit content across various genres and countries?
  
Our Data:
Our first dataset is focused on comprehensive data sets about top artists obtained from Spotify, which were then sorted and organized by an online Kaggle user. This offers detailed information on songs, artists, and user listening trends. We found this along with our second data set, which revolves around the top songs of 2024 in many different countries. These two datasets gave us information on how artists related to their songs and the countries their songs were popular in. We attemped to analyze the connection between music trends and geographical location to gain an understanding on how music may show culture.

Data and Ethical Considerations:
A few ethical considerations for our data sets might be about user privacy, data anonymization, and consent. However, since the data is aggregated and people are aware that their listening trends are already tracked by Spotify, we believe that this is not too big of a deal.

Limitations:
One limitation for our datasets is that in the second dataset, only certain countries are included. There could be many countries that are not included and this may skew our data. We are limited to just a few countries and cannot expand our analysis past this point.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
Firstly, we explored the energetic characteristics of music from different countries, identifying interesting variances. For example, our data indicates that the top songs of 2024 in Japan generally have higher energy levels compared to those listened to in America. This difference may reflect cultural variations in music preferences and production, highlighting that Japanese audiences might favor more vibrant and dynamic songs, which could influence the strategies of artists and producers aiming at these markets.

Secondly, we examined the impact of release formats on song performance, discovering that tracks released as part of an album typically receive more listener engagement and popularity than singles. This observation suggests that the success of a song could be influenced by its context, possibly due to the cohesive story or theme within an album, which may engage listeners on a deeper level.

Lastly, we investigated the presence of explicit content in music across various countries. Our analysis provides essential insights into cultural standards and listener preferences, uncovering significant differences that could inform content creation and marketing strategies.

To visualize our findings, we created detailed tables and graphics, offering an overview of our research outcomes. We created these tables to try and connect music trends to culture. By analyzing the popular music trends of different countries throughout the world, we can see what locations like energetic music, slow music, etc. to see how these people may enjoy different lifestyles. Music plays an major role in culture, and we believe that the music people listen to also affects lifestyles and in turn culture.
