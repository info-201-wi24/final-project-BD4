Firstly, we explored the energetic characteristics of music from different countries, identifying interesting variances. For example, our data indicates that the top songs of 2024 in Japan generally have higher energy levels compared to those listened to in America. This difference may reflect cultural variations in music preferences and production, highlighting that Japanese audiences might favor more vibrant and dynamic songs, which could influence the strategies of artists and producers aiming at these markets.

Secondly, we examined the impact of release formats on song performance, discovering that tracks released as part of an album typically receive more listener engagement and popularity than singles. This observation suggests that the success of a song could be influenced by its context, possibly due to the cohesive story or theme within an album, which may engage listeners on a deeper level.

Lastly, we investigated the presence of explicit content in music across various countries. Our analysis provides essential insights into cultural standards and listener preferences, uncovering significant differences that could inform content creation and marketing strategies.

To visualize our findings, we created detailed tables and graphics, offering an overview of our research outcomes. We created these tables to try and connect music trends to culture. By analyzing the popular music trends of different countries throughout the world, we can see what locations like energetic music, slow music, etc. to see how these people may enjoy different lifestyles. Music plays an major role in culture, and we believe that the music people listen to also affects lifestyles and in turn culture.
